NPM License Checker
===================

Original code is here: https://github.com/davglass/license-checker

### Additions

- Added argument `customLicenses` to be able to provide custom licenses which should be valid.
  For example: License `NEW` which should match if `new` appears in license. `--customLicenses "NEW:new,OTHER:other(.*)"`
